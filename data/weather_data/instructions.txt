After downloading the respective datasets and dividing them in to folders as described in the README, the paths
in the individual files need to be altered.

The 'train' path in all the 'yaml' files will be the same, i.e. the path of the clean train set - because
clean statistics will be calculated from there.

The 'val' path will be different for each experiment - because val.txt, contains the split used for test-time-training.
